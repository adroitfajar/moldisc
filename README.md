# MolDisc 1.0 will be available soon . . .




## Installation

Moldisc requires both tensorflow and torch environments. Due to possible version conflicts of tensorflow and torch MolDisc requires two separate conda environments for SMILES-X and GPT. In order to create and install the conda environments  run the requirements_main.txt and requirements_gpt.txt as follows

```
pip install -r requirements_main.txt
pip install -r requirements_gpt.txt
```
